# Data Science Portfolio
These repositories contain a collection of data science projects I completed for academic, certification, or self learning purposes. These projects are in the forms of R Scripts, JupyterNotebooks, Excel, and Python files. 

## Contents
### Machine Learning
#### [Policyholder Identification](https://github.com/benjammin97/PolicyholderIdentification#readme)
The objective of the Policyholder Identification project was to categorize current auto-insurance customers into groups based on risk based on number of claims, cost of claims, credit score, location, and several other factors. Data was scaled and preprocessed before machine learning model implementation. Different clustering methods and several parameters were tested to find the optimal solution. Profits increased by 30% by implementing different rates for different risk levels.

#### [Potential Customer Prediction](https://github.com/benjammin97/PotentialCustomerPrediction#readme)
The company wants to engage future customers to increase our client base. The company would
like to save money on material costs and instead wants to predict customers which customers to target. In
particular, the marketing team has acquired data about potential customers and wants to predict the number of
claims per customer and the claims cost per customer. Decision tree and kmeans methods were implemented as well as several parameters concurrently tested to determine the optimal solution. Company saved an average of $200 per customer by only choosing customers who are predicted to have 0 or 1 claim.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
#### [Cyclistic Bike Share](https://github.com/benjammin97/CyclisticBikeShare)
Various visualizations were developed used to identify trends in  bicycle customer base in order to try to convert more riders to members. Several recommendations were made to increase rider membership based on the data, such as a weekend membership, a one hour membership, and a 3PM-6PM membership.
