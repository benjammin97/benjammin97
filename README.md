# Data Science Portfolio
These repositories contain a collection of data science projects I completed for academic, certification, or self learning purposes. These projects are in the forms of R Scripts, JupyterNotebooks, Excel, and Python files. 

## Contents
### Machine Learning
#### [Policyholder Identification](https://github.com/benjammin97/PolicyholderIdentification#readme)
##### Project Summary
The data analyst is to use data and python code to categorize auto-insurance customers into groups based on risk level.
##### Desired Insights:
* How many groups should the data analyst categorize policyholders into?
* How can the data analyst use key metrics to determine the best model/hyperparameter combination?
##### Skills:
###### Python
* Data preprocessing to ensure data quality.
* Implementing two unsupervised machine learning models to search for data insights. 
* Performing exploratory analysis by iterating through two different clustering models and tuning hyperparameters to find the optimal solution. 


#### [Potential Customer Prediction](https://github.com/benjammin97/PotentialCustomerPrediction#readme)
##### Project Summary:
The company has asked the data analyst to determine which customers to take on from a new customer list. The company has given the analyst some historical data that he can use to make inferences on the new dataset. 
##### Desired Insights:
* Based on demographic data, how many accidents will the new customer have, and what will the costs be?
* Which customers should the company take on based on number of accidents/costs?
##### Skills:
###### Python
* Data population to reduce the number of rows lost in the dataset in both training and test dataset.
* Use of 75/25 train-test split to evaluate the performance of the supervised machine learning model.
* Tuning parameters and tuning hyperparameters during exploratory analysis to find the optimal model, paramater, and hyperparamater combination.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
#### [Cyclistic Bike Share](https://github.com/benjammin97/CyclisticBikeShare)
##### Project Summary:
The data analyst is to develop various visualizations to identify trends in bicycle customer base in order to convert more riders to members.
##### Desired Insights:
* What is the most popular time of day to ride for bike users?
* Do members ride at different times/for different durations than casual riders?
* How long is the average bike ride?
##### Skills:
###### R
* Clean data by removing unnecessary columns and rows.
* Develop bar graphs and line graphs to generate valuable insights.
##### Outcomes:
Based on insights gained by data visualizations, several recommendations were made to increase rider membership based on the data, such as a weekend membership, a one hour membership, and a 3PM-6PM membership.

### Modeling and Simulation
#### [Retirement Preparation Simulation](https://github.com/benjammin97/RetirementSimulation/blob/main/README.md)
##### Project Summary: 
The data analyst, in excel, is to model a retirement contribution plan from age 25 to 65 with no previous contributions to determine the amount needed to invest to have 1.5 million dollars by retirement age before taxes using the most realistic assumptions possible. 
##### Skills:
###### Excel
* Use stochastic processes to introduce the randomness of a real-world scenario.
* Use well-known distributions to develop a realistic model of retirement growth.
* Use the Data Table function in Excel to extract a large number of simulations simultaneously.
* Develop summary statistics to gain a full picture of which investment strategies will be successful.
##### Outcomes:
