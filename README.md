# Data Science Portfolio
These repositories contain a collection of data science projects I completed for academic, certification, or self learning purposes. These projects are in the forms of R Scripts, JupyterNotebooks, Excel, and Python files. 

## Contents
### Machine Learning
#### [Policyholder Identification](https://github.com/benjammin97/PolicyholderIdentification#readme)
##### Project Summary
Python code that categorizes auto-insurance customers into groups based on risk level.
##### Skills Used:
###### Python:
* Data preprocessing to ensure data quality.
* Implementing two unsupervised machine learning models to search for data insights. 
* Iterated through two different clustering models and several parameters to find the optimal solution. 
##### Outcomes:
* Profits increased by 30% by implementing different rates for different risk levels.

#### [Potential Customer Prediction](https://github.com/benjammin97/PotentialCustomerPrediction#readme)
##### Project Summary:
The company has asked the data analyst to determine which customers to take on from a new customer list. The company has given the analyst some historical data that he can use to make inferences on the new dataset. 
##### Desired Insights:
* Based on demographic data, how many accidents will the new customer have, and what will the costs be?
* Which customers should the company take on based on number of accidents/costs?
##### Skills:
###### Python:
* Data population to reduce the number of rows lost in the dataset in both training and test dataset.
* Use of 75/25 train-test split to evaluate the performance of the supervised machine learning model.
* 

### Data Analysis and Visualization
#### [Cyclistic Bike Share](https://github.com/benjammin97/CyclisticBikeShare)
Various visualizations were developed used to identify trends in  bicycle customer base in order to try to convert more riders to members. Several recommendations were made to increase rider membership based on the data, such as a weekend membership, a one hour membership, and a 3PM-6PM membership.

### Modeling and Simulation
#### [Retirement Preparation Simulation](https://github.com/benjammin97/RetirementSimulation/blob/main/README.md)
Modeled a retirement contribution plan from age 25 to 65 with no previous contributions to determine the amount needed to invest to have 1.5 million dollars by retirement age before taxes using the most realistic assumptions possible. Several potential plans emerged that satisfied the 1.5 million dollar requirement.
